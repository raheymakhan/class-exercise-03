    "Classify an unrated movie review as either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "For solving the above question, I would need movie reviews that are already rated. \n",
    "I will collect 500 reviews for the movie Avengers: Endgame (2019) along with their star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMDB site loads 25 movie reviews at a time. After that you need to click the 'Load More' button to get more reviews.\n",
    "For this I used webdriver from Selenium. I created a while loop that clicks on the Load More button and waits 1/2 second \n",
    "for more reviews to load. If the site loads more reviews within 1/2 second then the loop again clicks the Load More button.\n",
    "This process continues until the site takes more than 1/2 second to load the reviews. In that case, an exception arises, \n",
    "and we break the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have all our reviews opened up, I use BeautifulSoup to scrape the data. Each movie review is contained in a \n",
    "class = 'lister-item-content'. Not all reviews have star ratings.\n",
    "Therefore, for each container that has a star rating, we find the class = content, take the text in that class and remove \n",
    "'\\n' from the left side of the text. Then we store it in a list of reviews. So, we have a list of reviews.\n",
    "To get the star ratings, we find the class = 'ipl-ratings-bar', take the text that is stored in the span tag, remove '\\n'\n",
    "from both sides of the text, and append this text to our list of star_ratings. So, we have a list of star_ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last step is to create a dataframe with both reviews and star ratings. This data can now be used to train models that can \n",
    "automatically classify reviews.\n",
